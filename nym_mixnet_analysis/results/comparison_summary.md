| Random Forest | 98.79% | 98.83% | 98.79% | 98.79% |
| SVM (RBF Kernel) | 88.79% | 89.09% | 88.79% | 88.41% |
| Decision Tree | 98.48% | 98.51% | 98.48% | 98.49% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 91.82% | 91.77% | 91.82% | 91.77% |

### NYM Mixnet Clustering Results
| Method | Clusters | Noise Rate | Silhouette | Davies-Bouldin | Stability |
|--------|----------|------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| HDBSCAN | 10 | 25.58% | 0.906 | 0.199 | 0.775 |
| GMM-BIC | 7 | 0.00% | 0.394 | 1.632 | N/A |
| Spectral | 8 | 0.00% | -0.136 | 1.583 | N/A |

## Privacy Impact Assessment

### Device Identification Transformation
- **Original Devices**: 2 Smart Switch devices
- **Perceived Devices**: 10 distinct clusters (5x increase)
- **Privacy Enhancement**: Significant obfuscation of device identity

### Traffic Pattern Analysis
- **Baseline Vulnerability**: 98.79% identification accuracy (Random Forest)
- **Mixnet Protection**: Artificial pattern creation
- **Residual Risk**: High proxy classification accuracy suggests some pattern analysis still possible

## Feature Analysis

### Most Discriminative Features (Baseline)
1. Flow Duration
2. Packet Counts (Forward/Backward)
3. Inter-Arrival Time Statistics
4. Packet Length Statistics

### Feature Effectiveness in Mixnet
- **Obfuscation**: Features are transformed by mixnet processing
- **Artificial Patterns**: New feature distributions created
- **Noise Introduction**: 25.58% noise rate enhances privacy

## Conclusions

### Privacy Preservation Success
- **Device Identity**: Successfully obfuscated (2 â†’ 10 apparent devices)
- **Traffic Patterns**: Significantly altered through mixnet processing
- **Noise Addition**: Enhances privacy through uncertainty

### Limitations
- **Pattern Analysis**: Sophisticated ML may still identify some patterns
- **Consistency**: Stable patterns across time could be exploited
- **Feature Dependencies**: Reliance on specific feature sets

### Recommendations
1. **Multi-layered Privacy**: Combine mixnet with additional privacy techniques
2. **Dynamic Patterns**: Implement time-varying obfuscation
3. **Feature Diversity**: Use broader feature sets for analysis
4. **Regular Assessment**: Continuously evaluate privacy effectiveness

## Research Implications

This comparison demonstrates:
- **Effectiveness**: NYM mixnet provides substantial privacy protection
- **Trade-offs**: Privacy vs. detection capabilities
- **Practicality**: Feasible implementation on resource-constrained devices
- **Future Directions**: Need for enhanced privacy-preserving technologies

The analysis provides a foundation for understanding IoT privacy vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of privacy-preserving network technologies.
